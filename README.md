NWPusher
========

*Mac OS X application for playing with Apple's push notification service.*


About
-----
Testing push notifications in your app can be difficult, having to set up an SSL connection with Apple or send a payload through some server. NWPusher is an application that allows you to send push notifications from your Mac directly to Apple's servers. It uses your keychain to retreive push certifcates and keys, and provides a convenient configuration file to keep track of your device tokens.
